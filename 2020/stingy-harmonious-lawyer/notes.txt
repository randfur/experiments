- Infinite winding tube, camera flying through it.
- Tube made up of gems arranged around its surface, not an actual surface, variably sparce gem arrangement.
- Gems are made of two pyramids stuck together <> with variably angled "spokes" radiating from the point.
- Some gems have their peaks culled to make them more flat:

- Gems are reflective, should look very shiny as they rotate and move with respect to the camera.
- Can attempt faux internal reflections by ray casting onto a fake interior with a set number of internal bounces.
- Each fake interior can be parameterised differently for each face.
- Colour of gems can evolve via a slice of a cellular automata with a random value row at the bottom
- (e.g. like reading the middle row of https://ash-swordtail.glitch.me/) for each forward step of the tube surface.
