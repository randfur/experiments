- Game of life but with some twists.
  - In regular GOL cells die if there aren't enough alive cells around them.
  - Cells have direction.
  - Don't kill the cell if it's idle, have it move from one cell to the other.
  - When cells intersect this is where the GOL type rules take place.
- Have particles that are in floating point 2D space.
- Look at their discrete grid position each step to compute the GOL rules.
- Start off with if there are two then spawn a third going in a random direction.
- Copying the game engine code from 2024/asteroids.
  - Nvm it's not useful here.
- Each step:
  - Update particle position with their direction.
  - Get all grid positions of all particles.
  - Create/destroy particles based on grid rules.
  - Wait n milliseconds.
- Implemented this.
- POL rules:
  - If 3 particles next to an empty cell, spawn particle in cell.
  - If more than 3 particle next to a particle, kill particle.
- Looks like chaos.
