- Imported many Glitch projects.
  - Glitch is shutting down.
  - https://blog.glitch.com/post/changes-are-coming-to-glitch/
- Used bulk downloader:
  - https://support.glitch.com/t/glitch-project-bulk-downloading/75872
- Sorted everything by year.
  - Made a guess based on last modified dates of files.
  - Not totally accurate since it's last modified rather than true creation date.
  - Also many projects are forks of others so the creation date of untouched files would be inaccurate as well.
  - Also don't know the relative ordering within the year.
  - Not a big deal if +/- 1 year, doesn't really matter.
- Cleaned up non-static projects that were just serving static data anyway.
- Moved assets out of glitch-assets/ into project root folder.
- Cleaned up unnecessary Glitch files:
  - .bash_history
  - .config/
  - .data/
  - .env
  - .git/
  - .glitchdotcom.json
  - .viminfo
  - assets/
  - glitch-assets/
  - illustration.svg
  - my-folder/
  - package-lock.json
  - package.json
  - public/
  - README.md
  - server.js
  - shrinkwrap.yaml
  - static/
  - styles/
  - views/
- TODO:
  - Rewrite use of assets to use new location.
  - Remove the pattern of:
    ```js
    if (location.protocol != 'https:')
      location.protocol = 'https:';
    ```
    - This breaks localhost serving which is http:.
    - Done.
  - Remove use of https://glitch.com/edit/favicon-app.ico as the site icon.
    - Done.
  - Figure out what to do with the ones that use a service worker.
    - Need to scope it to the subdirectory.
    - Turns out that's the default behaviour, should be fine but need to check.
  - Check to see that each one works in the new environment.
  - Clean up the ones with nothing worthwhile in them.
  - Add them to the experiments index listing.
  - Spruce up the index listing.
    - Add screenshots and links to the notes.txt files for each project.
    - Make it clear which ones are still WIP and there's nothing to play with.
