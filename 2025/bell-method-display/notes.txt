- Make a display for bell methods.
  - See whiteboard.png.
  - Shows the positions each starting bell takes during a lead end.
  - Shows what happens during a bob/single.
  - Shows what bell each starting bell becomes at the end of their lead end.
  - Shows when a bell passes the treble.
- Need to detect hunt and treble bob bells that are never affected to display as reference.
  - Or maybe not?
