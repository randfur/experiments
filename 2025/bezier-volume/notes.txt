- Do https://randfur.github.io/experiments/2022/working-dynamic-cup/ but with a volume rather than just a surface.
- Have a 4x4 grid of 16 beziers going up the z axis.
- Generate 4 beziers for every layer.
- Generate n beziers for each of those 4 layer beziers.
- How to animate all this?
  - Maybe every control point flies through a little localised random bezier track in their space.
  - Then have two globally affecting bezier tracks that attract and repel the control points based on distance.
- Started implementing.
  - Rendered the scaffolding beziers with a bit of deviation.
  - Looks like seaweed.
  - Added dumb fish and made them swim in and out.
