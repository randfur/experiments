- Falling down a stream of buildings.
- Buildings are in an arcing path through space.
- At some point buildings break apart.
  - Use a plane of cutting to split the building model.
  - Find all edges that intersect the plane, create new vertices at those locations.
  - Create a new face using those vertices and split the existing faces.
  - Randomly add points in the middle of the split face to create a non-flat breakage.
