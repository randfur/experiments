- Falling down a stream of buildings.
- Buildings are in an arcing path through space.
- At some point buildings break apart.
  - Use a plane of cutting to split the building model.
  - Find all edges that intersect the plane, create new vertices at those locations.
  - Create a new face using those vertices and split the existing faces.
  - Randomly add points in the middle of the split face to create a non-flat breakage.
- Created a box with faces and size and position that draws.
- Added slice functionality.
  - Works for simple case.
  - Doesn't work so well for when the plane is upside down.
  - Haven't thought too hard about the face slice code just adding verticies to face A and B according to which side of the plane they're on, maybe ordering matters? Need to pen and paper it.
- Added simple time based variation of the slicing.
  - Showing off the broken slices.
  - Will get to broken inputs later.
- Nvm it wasn't broken, I was just pushing them into each other.
- Added different colour to one of the halves.
  - Hard coded, needs an API for it.
- TODO:
  - Add a face for the slice face.
  - Can't tell it's not there due to all the redundant rendering the model does.

- This looks good as is, going to leave this one be and start another project to continue the building slicing.
