# 2025-04-01
- Added basic touch rendering and repeat lines.

# 2025-03-30
- Refactored sequence rendering code out into functions.
- Much neater with each returning a createSvgElement().
- Added work detection and colouring.
- Added grouping for general placement.

# 2025-03-30
- Refactored code to use a createElement helper function.
  - A bit nicer.
- Made the sequence bigger.
  - Too big now, can't zoom out on mobile, maybe was better as it was.
  - Reverted size changes.

# 2025-03-29
- Split render functions out into separate files.
  - Cleans things up a bit.
- Added more SVG elements to render the bells list and places.
- Rendered blue line.
- How to render red line?
  - Not clear when there is a red line.
    - Method could specify maybe.
  - Hunt bell can change, should be a red line?
    - Much harder to detect.
    - But possible.
  - Leaving red lines out for now.
  - Will add as specified on the method maybe and leave out hunt bells.
- Still need to add blue line picker.
- Tried it on mobile, everything is tiny, need to scale everything up 4x.

# 2025-03-26
- Finished implementing the place notation touch overlay code.
- Implemented applying places to the bells.
- Implemented loop until repeat after end of calls.
- TODO:
  - Render bell sequences with place notation and lines and work highlights.
  - Add buttons for editing the touch.

# 2025-03-25
- Implementing the sequence code.
  - computeSequence().
  - computePlaces().
    - For a step index find where in the placeNotation it is and overlay the touches over the beginning/end.
  - Use the places to update the bell sequence.

# 2025-03-23
- Create app that helps plan out bell ringing method conducting.
- Needs:
  - UI:
    - Mobile friendly.
    - Sequence of conductor calls.
      - Plain, bob, single.
      - Editing sequence.
    - Different bell sequence displays.
      - Number grid.
      - Lines.
      - Selected line over number grid.
      - Highlight lead end work sequence.
  - Logic:
    - Method place notation.
    - Lead detection.
    - Repetition detection.
    - True detection.
  - Data model:
    - Saved methods.
      - Presets.
      - Custom saved.
      - Saved conducting sequences.
    - Selected method.
      - Current editing sequence.
- UI implementation.
  - Maybe rojs outputting SVG.
  - Haven't done that before.
  - Had to add the concept of XML namespaces and attributes to get it to work.
    - Tested out creating SVG elements, setting SVG styles, setting SVG attributes dynamically.
  - One problem is SVGs don't take on the size of their contents, they're absolutely sized.
    - Would need like a render callback to keep updating the SVG size on every change maybe.
      - This is a case that Rojs really doesn't work well for.
      - Might instead chunk the output up into multiple known size SVGs.
      - Might have to give them overlapping regions.
    - A non-Rojs approach would be to render everything every time.
      - Probably way simpler and would work perfectly fine.
      - No need for Rojs.
      - Will just do this.
- Implementation
  - Started from scratch with regular HTML inputs.
    - Rerenders everything on any user change.
    - TIL replaceChildren().
  - Defined the initial model state with method definitions.
  - Up to actually rendering the bell sequence.
