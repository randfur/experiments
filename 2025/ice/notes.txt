- Tweaked the parameters, added friction.
- Moved camera back.

- Added ice model to ship.
- Added rotation using GA.
  - Model is expected to be pointing along x axis.
  - Model is rotated to point in the direction of velocity.
  - Worked first try.
- Made the ice shards burst out from a point at the start.

- Implemented ships with random positions and velocities.
- Added behaviour rotation system.
  - Ship cycles through behaviour objects in a loop, progressing whenever a behaviour says it's finished.
  - Behaviours control the ship movement.
- Basic dot drawing works.

- Little ships in space flying around.
  - Picking a run up path.
  - Builds up speed.
  - Creates a large ice path in an arc, exhausting their built up speed in a big pitch up maneuver.
  - Wanders around before repeating.
- Ice runner out in space.
  - Camera following them.
  - Skates along the ice paths.
  - Little ships try to create ice paths for them to skate on.
  - Jumps from one path towards the next one.
  - If no path around just floats until a path is created for them to land on.
