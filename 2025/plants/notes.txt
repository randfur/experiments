- Use hex-lines to draw plant simulation.
- Seeds grow roots, stem, leaves, flower.
- Random bugs fly from flower to flower pollinating.
- Flowers turn to seeds that blow away in the breeze and grow where they land.
- Plant dies off once done.
- Maybe other types of plants.
  - Maybe generalised plant code with DNA configurations that allow it to be any kind of plant.
- Basic plant data:
  - Root.
    - Sub roots.
  - Stem.
    - Branches.
      - Leaves.
      - Flower.
- Started implementing, is a lot of work to get started.
- Probably need primitives to make basic concepts easier like having a root grow in various directions over time.
