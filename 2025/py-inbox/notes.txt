- A Python http server that receives and resends tagged messages.
- REST API:
  - /push/tag
  - /pull/tag
  - Body contains message.
- Pull endpoint blocks until there is a message to receive.
- Server can act as a synchronisation point between async receivers.
- Asked Gemini how to http server in Python: https://gemini.google.com/share/c7860c93391f
- Completed.
- Used REST param instead of body because processing body got more difficult.
- Added file level docstring with example usage.
