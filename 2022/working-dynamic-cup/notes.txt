- Things that make up the thing:
  - Draw lines with thickness.
  - Divide by z.
  - Near culling.
  - Camera rotation.
  - Beziers.
- Smoother bezier lines
  - Rewrite bezier drawing primitive.
  - Continue to do bisection.
  - Use camera transformed positions for distance threshold.
  - Sort screen points and screen width along t.
  - Generate quads to draw that join the edges of the line continuously.
- Bezier arc bug
  - When a bezier does a loop the bisect may hit either side of the intersection area and short circuit the loop.
  - Should test whether the midpoint is beyond the minimum distance threshold.
