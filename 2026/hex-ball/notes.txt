- Added ball hex directional keyboard movement.

- Extracted hex ball code into a function that just returns the points.
- Made a Model class that takes a source set of points, has a set of transform properties, translation, orientation and scale, and applies them to the source points onto a structured copy for rendering into HexLines.
- Using new singleton instances in ga library for transform matrices and orientation mutation.
- Works well, got a ball rolling now.

- Experiment with making a ball out of only hexagons.
- Hexagons will overlap, just see what it looks like.
- Started off with creating hex shapes on a sphere at random angles.
- Added fixed angle sphere hex shapes.
  - Need to rotate camera to see it better.
- Having trouble applying a Mat4 to the HexLines.transformMatrix.
  - Oops, forgot to set the hex lines to 3D.
- Oriented the hex plates to face the poles.
