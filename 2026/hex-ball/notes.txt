- Experiment with making a ball out of only hexagons.
- Hexagons will overlap, just see what it looks like.
- Started off with creating hex shapes on a sphere at random angles.
- Added fixed angle sphere hex shapes.
  - Need to rotate camera to see it better.
- Having trouble applying a Mat4 to the HexLines.transformMatrix.
