- There can be more concave turns than convex turns, the convex angles have to add up to greater but the individual counts of each could be anything.
- Second attempt:
  - For every convex turn take the triangle out if there are no other points inside it.
  - Can quadtrees be useful here?
    - Worth trying out to see the perf difference.

- Attempt at triangulating a polygon from scratch.
- Convex case is trivial.
  - All pairs of points go through the shape.
  - Create triangles connecting one point to every other.
- Concave harder.
  - Requires detecting when the outside comes inside the shape.
- First attempt:
  - Figure out the winding of the shape.
    - Can use atan2 and see what all the angles add up to.
    - Maybe there's a cheaper way.
      - Count all left and right turns.
      - The one with the higher count is the one that's turning inwards.
  - While there are remaining untriangluated points:
    - Find a pair of two consecutive inward turns.
    - Try making a triangle with the point before and after the pair.
    - If one creates a trangle which no other remaining untriangulated point intersects:
      - Add that triangle and remove the middle point.
    - Otherwise:
      - Keep looking for the next pair of two consecutive inward turns.
  - Tested by hand with a complex G like shape, it worked.
